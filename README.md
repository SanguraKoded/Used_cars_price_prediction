# Used_cars_price_prediction
In this data science project, we use machine learning techniques to predict the price of used cars based on a variety of features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains over 50,000 records and is sourced from a popular used car website. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and training, and performance evaluation. The resulting model can be used by individuals or businesses to estimate the value of a used car before purchasing or selling. The code is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn.
